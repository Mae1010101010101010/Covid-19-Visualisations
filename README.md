Can we predict a country's COVID-19 death rate per million using its case rate, vaccination progress, and testing strategy?

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict COVID-19 death rates per million using various country-level features such as vaccination rates, population density, testing levels, and GDP per capita. It also evaluates feature importance using a Random Forest model.
